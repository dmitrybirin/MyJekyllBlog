Chrome extensions are simple! 
Only an hour and you have a working redirecting extension from scratch.
Well, a really simple one, without UI and really shallow understanding of API.

But it works. I came with that idea, cause of continuous habit to type 'fa' in the omnibox and timetravel hours in future with facebook.
Now my extension redirect me to messenger, the only thing, that I actually need from FB.

You can check extension on the [github page][gh]

I'll try to add some UI to actually managing redirecting lists in the future.

Yeah, I know simple redirect solution can be more simple, but I always wanted to have my own chrome extension) 

btw: train scrapper stuff is on the go, but after examine different scrapping solution, I've decided to try using API instead.
In future posts I'll try to write comparison review of the scrapper libraries.
