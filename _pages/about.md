My name is Dmitry Birin, I am a software engineer, planet Earth.

##### *Cause Automated QA from Saint-Petersburg sounds a bit limiting:)*


Like to code, to learn something new. Currently interested in Machine Learning.
Hate to blog, but it can be useful to train mind be more focused and I was interesting in Jekyll...
So you're reading this, poor you, but stick around, it's get better:)
